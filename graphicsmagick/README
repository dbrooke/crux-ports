 - For RAW support, dcraw is required
 - For PDF support, ghostscript is required
 - For GPLT support, gnuplot and ghostscript are required
 - For TrueType annotating, freetype is required
 - To perform ICC CMS color management, lcms is required
 - For PNG, MNG, and JNG support, libpng is required
 - To import an image from a scanner, sane is required
 - For TIFF support, libtiff is required
 - For WMF support, libwmf is required
 - For some functions, an X server is required
 - For SVG support and network support, libxml2 is required
 - And more!
