# crux-ports

[CRUX](https://crux.nu/) is a lightweight Linux distribution for the x86-64
architecture targeted at experienced Linux users.

The official repositories do not include all the applications which I use and
these are my ports for some of those (and necessary dependencies) which I found
to be missing.
