# crux-ports

[CRUX](https://crux.nu/) is a lightweight Linux distribution for the x86-64
architecture targeted at experienced Linux users.

The official repositories do not include all the applications which I use and
these are my ports for some of those (and necessary dependencies) which I found
to be missing.

To install the ports in this repository copy
[dbrooke.httpup](http://crux-ports.dbrooke.me.uk/dbrooke.httpup) and
[dbrooke.pub](http://crux-ports.dbrooke.me.uk/dbrooke.pub) to /etc/ports and
enable the contrib repository.
